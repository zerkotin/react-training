# Pure Components
When facing issues with many recurring renders that affect performance you can try to use `React.PureComponent`
instead of `React.Component`

`React.PureComponent` has a default implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` which will prevent unecesary renders.

```javascript
class List extends React.PureComponent {
  // ... the rest is the same
}
```
